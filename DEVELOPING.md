# Developer Guide

This repository contains a monorepo where multiple packages are managed using Yarn workspaces and Lerna.

## Set up development environment

**Prerequisites**

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 12
-   [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/) (recent/latest version)

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies

```sh-session
$ yarn install

# build all packages once, so imports between them work
$ yarn build
```

## Build

You can invoke builds for all packages from the root directory of the monorepo.

```sh-session
$ yarn build
```

## Code style

The ethlogger codebase employs certain rules regarding code style. Rule are defined in config files and enforced by CI:

-   [.editorconfig](./.editorconfig) ([Learn more](https://editorconfig.org/))
-   [.prettierrc](./.prettierrc) ([Learn more](https://prettier.io/))

We also use a [common package](./packages/eslint-config) for managing our TypeScript code style rules using eslint.

### Linting

We are using [eslint](https://eslint.org) to enforce certain code style rules. Violation will cause CI checks not to pass. You can locally run eslint to check for any potential linter warning or errors:

```sh-session
$ yarn lint
```

Eslint can also automatically fix certain errors automatically if you pass the `--fix` option.

```sh-session
$ yarn lint --fix
```

## Run tests

There are several unit tests in this repo. In order for CI checks to pass, all tests need to complete successfully.

To execute them, simply run:

```sh-session
$ yarn test
```

You can also execute tests in watch mode, which will automatically re-run tests as you make changes:

```sh-session
$ yarn test --watch
```

## Integration Tests

We do have integration tests for one package currently (HEC client). Instructions on how to run it can be found in the [integration test readme](./packages/hec-client/integration/README.md).

## Committing

This project uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), which enforce a particular format for commit messages.

> The commit message should be structured as follows:
>
> ```
>    <type>[optional scope]: <description>
>
>    [optional body]
>
>    [optional footer(s)]
> ```
>
> The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the
> consumers of your library:
>
> 1. **fix:** a commit of the _type_ `fix` patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with [`PATCH`](http://semver.org/#summary) in semantic versioning).
> 1. **feat:** a commit of the _type_ `feat` introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with [`MINOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in semantic versioning).
> 1. **BREAKING CHANGE:** a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with [`MAJOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in semantic versioning).
>    A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any _type_.
> 1. _types_ other than `fix:` and `feat:` are allowed, for example [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) (based on the [the Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines)) recommends `build:`, `chore:`,
>    `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, and others.
> 1. _footers_ other than `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` may be provided and follow a convention similar to
>    [git trailer format](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers).
>
> Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in semantic versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE).
> <br /><br />
> A scope may be provided to a commit's type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., `feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays`.

### Validation

A pre-commit hook provided by [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky#readme) checks that the message contents match a conventional commit.

If your changes are valid, you will see the following output:

```sh-session
husky > pre-commit (node v14.0.0)
üîç  Finding changed files since git revision ffffffff.
üéØ  Found 1 changed file.
‚úçÔ∏è  Updating docs/developing.md.
‚úÖ  Everything is awesome!
```

If your commit doesn't follow conventional commit guidelines, you will see this instead:

```sh-session
üîç  Finding changed files since git revision ffffffff.
üéØ  Found 0 changed files.
‚úÖ  Everything is awesome!
husky > commit-msg (node v14.0.0)
‚ßó   input: This change adds documentation for contributors to help them understand

how the repository is managed.
It provides guidance on how to form commits using the git-cz tool.
‚úñ   subject may not be empty [subject-empty]
‚úñ   type may not be empty [type-empty]
‚ö†   body must have leading blank line [body-leading-blank]

‚úñ   found 2 problems, 1 warnings

husky > commit-msg hook failed (add --no-verify to bypass)
```

### Creating a conventional commit

You can write a conventional commit by following the guidelines above.

The specification contains a number of [examples.](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#examples)

You can also read prior commits for inspiration with `git log`.

### Using `git-cz`

git cz makes writing [semantic Git commits](https://github.com/streamich/git-cz) easy.

You can run `git-cz` with npx:

```sh-session
npx git-cz
```

You can also install git-cz globally:

```sh-session
npm install -g git-cz
```

Then you can run git-cz with:

```sh-session
git cz
```

Stage your changes as usual with `git add` and `git rm`, then run `git cz`.

A dialog will appear from which you can make a selection of the type of change:

```sh-session
? Select the type of change that you're committing:
  üé∏  feat:       A new feature
  üêõ  fix:        A bug fix
  ü§ñ  chore:      Build process or auxiliary tool changes
‚ùØ ‚úèÔ∏è  docs:       Documentation only changes
  üí°  refactor:   A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
  üíÑ  style:      Markup, white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons...
  üé°  ci:         CI related changes
(Move up and down to reveal more choices)
```

After pressing Enter, you can enter a short description of the commit:

```sh-session
? Write a short, imperative mood description of the change:
  [-------------------------------------------------------------] 3 chars left
   docs: Document conventional commits and semantic releases.
```

You can then enter a longer description of the change:

```sh-session
? Provide a longer description of the change:
  This change adds documentation for contributors to help them understand how the repository is managed.
```

You can then list any breaking changes the code change introduces:

```sh-session
? List any breaking changes
  BREAKING CHANGE:
```

If you have no breaking change, you can press enter.

You can enter the number of the issue fixed by the commit:

```sh-session
? Issues this commit closes, e.g #123:
```

If no issues are fixed with the commit, you can press enter to bypass the prompt.

If you want to change the contents of the commit, you can run `git cz --amend`. [See more about `git commit --amend`.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History)

## Publishing

Packages are published from the main branch, using lerna semantic-release-like publish flow:

```sh-session
$ yarn lerna publish --conventional-commits --no-commit-hooks
```

This requires access to Git and NPM (the @splunkdlt scope). There is currently no CI setup for automated publishing of packages.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases from changes not yet merged into main can be published as well:

```sh-session
$ yarn lerna publish --canary --conventional-prerelease --preid=preview --pre-dist-tag=my-branch-preview
```
